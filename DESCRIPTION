Description: doubletrouble aims to identify duplicated genes from
    whole-genome protein sequences and classify them based on their modes
    of duplication. The duplication modes are: 
    i. whole-genome duplication (WGD);
    ii. tandem duplication (TD);
    iii. proximal duplication (PD);
    iv. transposed duplication (TRD) and;
    v. dispersed duplication (DD).
    If users want a simpler classification scheme, duplicates can also be
    classified into WGD- and SSD-derived (small-scale duplication) gene pairs.
    Besides classifying gene pairs, users can also classify genes, so that
    each gene is assigned a unique mode of duplication.
